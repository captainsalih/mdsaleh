Research on atomistic simulations aimed at elucidating the **fundamental nature of chemical reactions** in solution, both in the **liquid** phase and at **solid–liquid** interfaces. The work combines *ab initio* approaches such as **DFT** and electronic structure methods (**HF, MP2, CCSD**) with **machine-learning** techniques to explore reactivity across multiple scales.
